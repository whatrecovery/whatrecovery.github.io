They want to raise interest rates to slow down job growth and prevent wages from rising faster. </p> <p> We stand with millions of workers and their families in calling on the Federal Reserve to adopt pro-worker policies for the rest of us. The Fed can keep interest rates low; give the economy a fair chance to recover; and prioritize full employment and rising wages. </p> </div> </div> </div> </section>
