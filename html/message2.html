This is particularly true in communities of color and among young workers. </p> <p> Some members of the Federal Reserve refuse to see that truth. They think that the economy has recovered. They want to raise interest rates to slow down job increases and prevent wages from rising faster. </p> <p> Thatâ€™s a terrible idea. The Fed needs to publicly commit to keeping interest rates low until all communities experience a full recovery, and everybody who wants to can find a good job. </p> </div> </div> </div> </section>
